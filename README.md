## Storm-Kafka

A beautiful marriage between [Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm) and [Kafka](http://incubator.apache.org/kafka). Seriously though, this library will let you use Kafka as a spout within Storm. It is based on the [storm-kestrel](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-kestrel) spout but in the end, don't share too much in common.

### Notes

See the javadoc of the KafkaSpout for details. The biggest thing to note is that the current implementation does not guarantee reliability in the Storm topology.
